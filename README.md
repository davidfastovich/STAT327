# STAT327

I'm guessing if you're in this repository then you're probably using it as help for your STAT327 Homework/Quizzes and you've come to the right place! These quizzes and homeworks reflect a lot of work on my part and a lot of learning. I started this class with absolutely no knowledge of R and came out of it comfortable to tackle any challenges in my research. That being said, please only use this as a resource, do not copy my homework or quizzes, it'll do you no good, but I know how helpful seeing another persons code can be, which is why I've made this public. So do your best to code everything on your own and use this when you get stuck.

As a warning, my code may not be 100% right. I got a good grade in the first section, decent grade in the second, and a good grade in the third section.

Good luck in the class, and I hope you get as much from it as I did!
